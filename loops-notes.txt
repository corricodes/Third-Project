Using the Regular "for Loop with Arrays [Day 38]

    Years ago, we didn't have the for-of loop in JavaScript.

    To still loop through all the elements of an array, this code could be used:

        for (let i = 0; i < someArray.length; i++) {
            console.log(someArray[i]);
        }

    This code still works today and you can absolutely use it instead of using for-of loop. But of course it's longer and a bit more clunky, so there is no strong reason to use that code, unless you prefer it.
