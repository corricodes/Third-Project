What are boolean values ("Booleans")?
    A value type which only knows two possible values: true or false. Very useful for "if" statements!

What is the idea behind "if" statements?
    if statements control whether some code is executed or not.

Given the below code, what would be the output you get in the console?
        const userAge = 52;
        if (userAge > 60 && userAge < 100) {
            console.log('User is in our target customer group!');
        } else if (userAge < 30) {
            console.log('User is a potential future customer.');
        } else {
            console.log('User is also an interesting customer!');
        }
    
    User is an interesting customer!

What's the idea behind "comparison operators" like == or <?
    These operators can be used to derive boolean values from other values.

What's the diffrence between the == and the === operators?
    === compare values and types, == compares values only.

What's the idea behind "logical operators" like && or ||?
    You can combine multiple boolean values and derive a new boolean value.

What's the idea behind "truthy" and "falsy" values?
    In places where boolean is expected, JS tries to "convert" non=booleanvalues to "truthy"/"falsy" values.
